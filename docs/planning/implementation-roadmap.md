# Claude Server MCP: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the proposed development roadmap for the Claude Server MCP project, addressing current limitations and planning future enhancements to create a production-ready context management system.

## Priority Issues

### Immediate Fixes (v0.1.1)

1. **Fix Home Directory Resolution** - [Issue #1](https://github.com/davidteren/claude-server/issues/1)
   - Replace tilde (`~`) with proper `process.env.HOME || os.homedir()`
   - Add proper error handling for path resolution
   - Test with multiple MCP clients (not just Claude Desktop)

2. **Enhance Context Listing** - [Issue #2](https://github.com/davidteren/claude-server/issues/2)
   - Implement proper listing without requiring project ID
   - Add project discovery functionality
   - Create mechanism for session persistence

3. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add comprehensive try/catch blocks
   - Improve error messages and codes
   - Add logging infrastructure

### Short-term Improvements (v0.2.0)

1. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Implement unit tests for core functionality
   - Add integration tests for MCP integration
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add input validation and sanitization
   - Implement path traversal prevention
   - Add parameter validation

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Optimize index usage for faster lookups
   - Implement pagination for large result sets
   - Add caching for frequently accessed contexts

### Medium-term Goals (v0.3.0)

1. **Enhanced Context Management**
   - Implement context versioning
   - Add search capabilities across contexts
   - Create context archiving functionality

2. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Add bulk operations for contexts
   - Implement context templates
   - Create better error reporting

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Support for binary attachments
   - Add context merging capabilities
   - Implement cross-context references

### Long-term Vision (v1.0.0)

1. **Enterprise Features**
   - Add optional encryption for sensitive contexts
   - Implement multi-user support
   - Create access control mechanisms

2. **Integration Capabilities**
   - API endpoints for external systems
   - Webhook support for context events
   - Integration with other storage backends

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Context usage statistics
   - Performance metrics
   - Usage pattern analysis

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation Hardening

**Duration**: 2-4 weeks
**Focus**: Fix critical issues, improve error handling, add basic tests

1. Address all immediate fixes from v0.1.1
2. Create basic test infrastructure
3. Implement proper error handling and logging
4. Document code with JSDoc comments

### Phase 2: Feature Completeness

**Duration**: 4-8 weeks
**Focus**: Complete core functionality, add missing features

1. Implement all short-term improvements
2. Add context versioning and search
3. Improve performance for large context collections
4. Enhance documentation with examples

### Phase 3: Production Readiness

**Duration**: 8-12 weeks
**Focus**: Hardening, security, performance

1. Comprehensive security review
2. Performance benchmarking and optimization
3. Complete test coverage
4. User acceptance testing

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

**Duration**: Ongoing
**Focus**: Enterprise features, integrations

1. Implement enterprise features
2. Add integration capabilities
3. Develop advanced analytics
4. Community feedback and contributions

## Resource Requirements

### Development Resources

- 1-2 JavaScript/TypeScript developers
- 1 QA/Test engineer (part-time)
- DevOps support for CI/CD pipeline

### Infrastructure

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Test environment for integration testing
- Documentation hosting

## Success Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: >80% unit test coverage
- **Issues Resolved**: All critical and high priority issues closed
- **Performance**: Context retrieval <100ms for 99% of requests
- **Security**: No critical or high vulnerabilities
- **Documentation**: Complete API and usage documentation

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to evolving the Claude Server MCP from its current early development stage to a production-ready solution. By addressing immediate issues while planning for future enhancements, we can create a robust context management system that significantly enhances Claude's capabilities.
