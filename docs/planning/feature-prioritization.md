# Claude Server MCP: Feature Prioritization

## Overview

This document outlines the prioritization of features and improvements for the Claude Server MCP project, helping to guide development efforts based on impact, complexity, and user needs.

## Prioritization Matrix

Features are prioritized using the following matrix:

| Priority | Impact | Effort | Description |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| P0 | High | Any | Critical bugs and security issues that block functionality |
| P1 | High | Low/Medium | High-impact features that are relatively easy to implement |
| P2 | Medium | Low | Medium-impact features that are easy to implement |
| P3 | High | High | High-impact features that require significant effort |
| P4 | Medium | Medium/High | Features with moderate impact that require more effort |
| P5 | Low | Any | Nice-to-have features with limited impact |

## Feature Prioritization

2. **Context Analytics**
   - Usage statistics
   - Insights on context usage
   - Medium implementation effort

3. **Integration with External Systems**
   - APIs for third-party access
   - Webhook support
   - High implementation effort

### P5 - Nice to Have

1. **UI for Context Management**
   - Visual management of contexts
   - High implementation effort
   - Limited core functionality impact

2. **Multi-user Support**
   - Multiple users with separate contexts
   - Access control
   - High implementation effort

3. **Context Visualization**
   - Graphical representation of relationships
   - Medium implementation effort
   - Limited core functionality impact

## Implementation Waves

### Wave 1: Core Stability (v0.1.x)

- All P0 issues
- Basic testing infrastructure
- Documentation updates

### Wave 2: Enhanced Functionality (v0.2.x)

- P1 features
- Selected P2 features
- Improved testing

### Wave 3: Advanced Features (v0.3.x)

- Remaining P2 features
- Selected P3 features
- Performance optimizations

### Wave 4: Complete Solution (v1.0.x)

- Remaining P3 features
- Selected P4 features
- Enterprise readiness

### Wave 5: Extended Capabilities (v1.x+)

- Remaining P4 features
- P5 features as resources allow
- Community-driven enhancements

## User Impact Analysis

### Critical User Needs

1. **Cross-client Compatibility**
   - Impacts: All users not using Claude Desktop
   - Addressed in: Wave 1

2. **Session Continuity**
   - Impacts: All users requiring persistent context
   - Addressed in: Wave 1

3. **Organization Capabilities**
   - Impacts: Users with many contexts
   - Addressed in: Wave 2

4. **Data Security**
   - Impacts: Users with sensitive information
   - Addressed in: Wave 3

### User Personas

1. **Individual Developer**
   - Primary needs: Basic context persistence, ease of use
   - Key features: Cross-client compatibility, simple organization

2. **Team Developer**
   - Primary needs: Shared contexts, organization
   - Key features: Context discovery, tagging, templates

3. **Enterprise User**
   - Primary needs: Security, compliance, scale
   - Key features: Encryption, access controls, audit logging

## Conclusion

By focusing first on critical stability issues (P0) and then moving to high-impact features, the Claude Server MCP can quickly evolve into a more robust and useful tool. This prioritization balances the need for immediate fixes with the longer-term goal of creating a comprehensive context management solution.

Regular reassessment of priorities based on user feedback and emerging needs will ensure that development efforts remain aligned with actual user requirements.
